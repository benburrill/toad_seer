Toad Seer
=========

A super simple explicit single-particle time-dependent Schr√∂dinger
equation solver/viewer.

I used this to play around with multi-level Rabi problems in the
(perturbed) infinite square well and wrote a term paper about my
findings for a class.
You can read `<NumericalRabi.pdf>`_ for details, or just watch an
animation of the wavefunction's PDF jiggling between 3 states by
running:

.. code::

    $ python3 -m toad_seer

from this directory.  You'll need numpy and matplotlib.
